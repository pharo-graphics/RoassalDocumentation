# The RoassalPro Program

## Why RoassalPro?
The field of visualization is large, and competition is pretty though. Despite the multiple visualization tools and frameworks available, Roassal has succeeded in attracting a solid user base. This page describes the plan we have to structure the effort around the development of Roassal.

Roassal was born in 2007. Since its inception, Roassal was deeply redesigned multiple times. Roassal, the current version of the Roassal series, culminates from all the previous experiences. 

Roassal is used by many open-source and proprietary software systems. We, the development team behind Roassal, are truly happy about it. We believe that Roassal makes Pharo a better system, and the current and future generations of Pharo developers deserve a competitive visualization support. The widespread adoption of Roassal within the Pharo and Smalltalk communities comes with responsibilities. _We, the leading development team of Roassal, are taking these community-emerged responsibilities very seriously_: the Pharo community is putting some trust on us, and we must be up to it.

Roassal is currently supported by a team of full-time and part-time software engineers dedicated to the development of Roassal. As you can guess, making sure that monetary resources can flow is central to cope with increasingly demanding users. 

## Services

RoassalPro is a program to help you to get the most of Roassal. RoassalPro is about ensuring particular needs are properly addressed, in a professional fashion. The RoassalPro program offers a number of services:

- **S1: Designing visualization**. Building and evaluating a visualization is a difficult activity that involves not only technical skills, but also ability to design and run experimental protocols. We do have a solid experience in building and assessing visualization for complex domains. We are happy to share our experience by designing and building Roassal-related applications, proprietary or not. The book [Agile Visualization](http://agilevisualization.com) gives many examples, but for Roassal2.
- **S2: Developping visual application**. We have experience in building profesional applications using visualization and integration. Here is an example of an application we built: [Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZB00Wwqxvc), a software analysis environment for JavaScript.
- **S3: Developping high-level layers**. Roassal can be used as a low-level library to build complex applications, on which sophisticated layers can greatly benefit. For example, the [Telescope](https://github.com/TelescopeSt/Telescope) environment for reverse engineering is using Roassal using a dedicated [connector](https://github.com/TelescopeSt/TelescopeRoassal).
- **S4: Developping specific components**. Roassal comes with many features. However, development teams often come with particular requirements. As such, with a financial support, we can develop a particular visualization or extension of Roassal. For example, we have recently fulfilled the need of a company by designing [exporters](https://github.com/pharo-graphics/RoassalExporters) of Roassal visualizations.
